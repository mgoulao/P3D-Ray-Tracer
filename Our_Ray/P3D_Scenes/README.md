# P3F Format File (with some extensions made by us)

## INTRODUCTION
The P3F (P3D file Format) is designed as a minimal scene description 
language for the scenes used to benchmark the ray tracers developed by 
the students in P3D Course. It is based on the NFF (Neutral File Format) 
language developed by Eric Haines. Some of the test scenes used in the 
Course are based on the SPD (Standard Procedural Database) software, a 
package designed to create a variety of databases for testing rendering 
schemes (http://www.acm.org/tog/resources/SPD/)
P3F is meant to describe the geometry and basic surface characteristics 
of objects, the placement of lights, and the viewing frustum for the eye 
and has minimal support for lighting and shading. However, P3DFF extends
NFF, by providing parameterization to support specular color in the 
material, environmental cubemaps and an extended camera with depth-offield (DOF) effect.
Presently the following entities are supported:
* Viewing camera with simple perspective frustum and thin lens
* A background color description
* A Environmental cubemap (skybox)
* A positional (vs. directional) light source description
* Material shading surface properties 
* Geometric objects: plane, Polygon, polygonal patch, sphere, box 
and cylinder/cone descriptions
Files are output as lines of text. For each entity, the first field 
defines its type. The rest of the line and possibly other lines contain 
further information about the entity. Entities include:
"v" - viewing camera
"bclr" - background color 
"env" â€“ environmental cubemap (skybox)
"l" - positional light location
"f" - object material properties
"c" - cone or cylinder primitive
"s" - sphere primitive
"pl" - plane primitive
"box" - box primitive
"p" - polygon primitive
"pp" - polygonal patch primitive
These are explained in depth below.DESCRIPTION
Comment. Description:

Format:
 # [ string ]
 As soon as a "#" character is detected, the rest of the line is 
considered a comment.
--------
Viewing camera. Description:
 "v"
 "from" Fx Fy Fz
 "at" Ax Ay Az
 "up" Ux Uy Uz
 "angle" angle
 "hither" hither
 "resolution" xres yres
 "aperture" aperture_ratio
 "focal" focal_ratio
Format:
 v
 from %g %g %g
 at %g %g %g
 up %g %g %g
 angle %g
 hither %g
 resolution %d %d
 aperture %g
 focal %g
The parameters are:
 From: the eye location in XYZ.
 At: a position to be at the center of the image, in XYZ world
 coordinates. A.k.a. "lookat".
 Up: a vector defining which direction is up, as an XYZ vector.
 Angle: in degrees, defined as from the center of top pixel row to
 bottom pixel row and left column to right column.
 Hither: distance of the hither plane (if any) from the eye. Mostly
 needed for hidden surface algorithms.
 Resolution: in pixels, in x and in y
 Aperture: lens aperture expressed as multiple of pixel size
 Focal: ratio between the focal distance and the viewplane distance.
 Note that no assumptions are made about normalizing the data (e.g. the from-at distance does not have to be 1). Also, vectors are not
 required to be perpendicular to each other.
 Some viewing parameters are always the same:
 Yon is "at infinity."
 Aspect ratio is 1.0.
 
--------
Background color. A color is simply RGB with values between 0 and 1:
 "bclr" R G B
Format:
 bclr %g %g %g
 If no background color is set, assume RGB = {0,0,0}.
--------
Environmental cubemap (skybox). Directory name containing the 6 maps of 
the skybox:
 "env" cubemap_dir
Format:
 env %s
--------
*Positional light.* A light is defined by XYZ position. Description:
 `l X Y Z [R G B]`
Format:
 `l %g %g %g [%g %g %g]`
 Lights have a non-zero intensity of no particular value, if not 
specified (i.e. the program can determine a useful intensity as desired); 
the red/green/blue color of the light can optionally be specified.
--------
*Area light.* A area light is defined by XYZ position, a 'at' vector, and height and width. Description:
 `al X Y Z Ax Ay Az w h [R G B]`
Format:
 `al %g %g %g %g %g %g [%g %g %g]`
Area lights inherits positional light behaviour
--------
*Fill color and shading parameters.* Description:
 "f" red green blue Kd red green blue Ks Shine T index_of_refraction
Format:
 f %g %g %g %g %g %g %g %g %g %g %g Each RGB channel ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.
 The first RGB color regards the diffuse color. The second RGB 
specifies the specular color. Kd is the diffuse component, Ks the 
specular, Shine is the Phong cosine power for highlights and T is 
transmittance. Usually, 0 <= Kd <= 1 and 0 <= Ks <= 1, though it is not 
required that Kd + Ks == 1.
If T = 0, the object is opaque. 
If T > 0, then the object is transparent and it should be used the 
Fresnel equations to calculate both reflectance and transmittance (the 
fractions of the contributions of the reflecting and transmitting rays). 
 The fill color is used to shade the objects following it until a new 
color is assigned.
--------
Cylinder or cone. A cylinder is defined as having a radius and an axis
 defined by two points, which also define the top and bottom edge of 
the
 cylinder. A cone is defined similarly, the difference being that 
the apex
 and base radii are different. The apex radius is defined as being 
smaller
 than the base radius. Note that the surface exists without endcaps. 
The
 cone or cylinder description:
 "c"
 base.x base.y base.z base_radius
 apex.x apex.y apex.z apex_radius
Format:
 c
 %g %g %g %g
 %g %g %g %g
 A negative value for both radii means that only the inside of the 
object is visible (objects are normally considered one sided, with the 
outside
visible). Note that the base and apex cannot be coincident for a 
cylinder or cone. Making them coincident could be used to define 
endcaps, but none of the test scenes currently make use of this 
definition.
--------
Sphere. A sphere is defined by a radius and center position:
 "s" center.x center.y center.z radius
Format:
 s %g %g %g %g If the radius is negative, then only the sphere's inside is visible
 (objects are normally considered one sided, with the outside 
visible).
 Currently none of the test scenes make use of negative radii.
--------
Plane. A plane is defined by the coordinates of three points:
 "pl" p1.x p1.y p1.z p2.x p2.y p2.z p3.x p3.y p3.z
Format:
 pl %g %g %g %g %g %g %g %g %g
 The three points coplanar. 
--------
Polygon. A polygon is defined by a set of vertices. With these 
databases,
 a polygon is defined to have all points coplanar. A polygon has 
only
 one side, with the order of the vertices being counterclockwise as 
you
 face the polygon (right-handed coordinate system). The first two 
edges must form a non-zero convex angle, so that the normal and side 
visibility can be determined by using just the first three vertices. 
Description:
 "p" total_vertices
 vert1.x vert1.y vert1.z
 [etc. for total_vertices vertices]
Format:
 p %d
 [ %g %g %g ] <-- for total_vertices vertices
--------
Mesh. A mesh is defined by a set of vertices and an indexed faces 
(triangles) set. With these databases, each triangle has the same 
properties described above. The indexed face set starts with 1 (first
vertex of the vertices set) or -1 (the last vertex of the vertices 
set). Description:
 "mesh" total_vertices total_triangles
 vert1.x vert1.y vert1.z
 [etc. for total_vertices vertices]
 index1 index2 index3
 [etc. for total_triangles triangles]Format:
 p %d %d
 [ %g %g %g ] <-- for total_vertices vertices
 [ %d %d %d ] <-- for total_triangles triangles
--------
Polygonal patch. A patch is defined by a set of vertices and their 
normals.
 With these databases, a patch is defined to have all points coplanar.
 A patch has only one side, with the order of the vertices being
 counterclockwise as you face the patch (right-handed coordinate 
system).
 The first two edges must form a non-zero convex angle, so that the 
normal
 and side visibility can be determined. Description:
 "pp" total_vertices
 vert1.x vert1.y vert1.z norm1.x norm1.y norm1.z
 [etc. for total_vertices vertices]
Format:
 pp %d
 [ %g %g %g %g %g %g ] <-- for total_vertices vertices
